# Analysis Dataset Description (TidyDataSet.txt)

Measure Field Name Field Decode: aaa.bbb.ccc.d where

- aaa = Summarization Function (i.e., Avg = Average) - applied to all measure columns 
- bbb = Signal (e.g., tBodyAcc)
- ccc = original function applied to signal (i.e., mean or std -> standard deviation)
- d = direction (i.e., x, y or z) Note does not apply to all measurements
